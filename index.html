                                            I'm a graduate from the University of Leicester, who is employed as a
                                            software developer at Ford Credit Europe and resides in London. I am part of
                                            an recently established development team embracing agile techniques in day
                                            to
                                            day operations, whilst also working on a modern tech stack with new and
                                            familiar technologies.</p>
                                        <p>A big part of my life is technology, whether it be by keeping up to date with
                                            the news regarding futurism, or by keeping a close eye on current hardware
                                            trends, I thoroughly enjoy learning about technology and always try to
                                            expand my knowledge whenever possible, even outside of my general working
                                            environment and I believe this may be why I am so motivated to advance my
                                            career as a software developer and why I enjoy it so much!</b></p>

                                                    In addition to technology I am also captivated by travelling and
                                                    exploring some unique and interesting countries. I have luckily been
                                                    fortunate enough to explore some countries that greatly interest me
                                                    such as exploring the fjords of Norway and the beaches of Australia
                                                    and have also visited a wide range of different countries such as
                                                    South Africa and the Maldives. By travelling and exploring these
                                                    fantastic locations around the globe I believe my cultural
                                                    appreciation has improved and that I am now very open to visiting
                                                    new locations and meeting with new people.

                                        I work in a team of agile software developers working on strategic business critical applications using a range of front and backend technologies. Whilst also building CI pipelines using Jenkins, Infrastructure planning and management using PCF and designing and building databases using Spring JPA ORM with MSSQL as the underlying database technology.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I work an Agile way with the following technologies: Spring, Java (11), Html, CSS, Angular, Jenkins for CI, PCF, ADFS for internal user authentication (SSO), MSSQL, Git (GitHub) and Agile central for project management. I primarily write code using IntelliJ IDE and have had several years’ experience doing so.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I have played a pivotal role in the creation of two significant applications from scratch using a modern tech stack.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Application 1 -  This is a tool now in production developed for marketing and sales, which combined a large amount of data interrogated from SOAP API/s with front end-user input screens built with JS and backend business logic operations built with Spring boot. The application combined and transformed data from various sources such as legacy systems and allowed user data to be input, then exported and processed using Alteryx.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Application 2 - I am currently working on a business-critical microservices-based API project developed with spring boot and related spring components. This service provides batch processing of vehicle and financial data for European markets, which subsequently feeds various downstream systems with mappings of multiple sources of data based on business need. A frontend has also been developed in Angular (using material design) allowing business users to input data to flow downstream.

                                        These projects have allowed me to work collaboratively within a professional environment, which has transformed my mindset towards efficient team-based output.
                                        Exposure to new technologies and methodologies has enriched my technological prowess, allowing me the opportunity to implement and improve existing development practices in turn furthering the skills of the team.

                        <h2 class="title-lg text-upper">More About Me / The Technologies I Use</h2>
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>My journey into the arts of computing started at a young age when I discovered computers and
                            their vast capabilities. I was hooked and progressed through various languages and operating
                            systems as I progressed through school and sixth form using home and school computers until
                            the present day where I program competently on Linux and Microsoft Windows and have dabbled
                            with Android and various new frameworks as they have appeared throughout the years.
                            <br><br>
                            Currently I am primarily using Windows as an operating system, however I often use Linux to
                            manage servers and am happy to use a command line (More exposure would be beneficial), I am
                            currently delving into Openshift and the concept of containerization which I have linked
                            with Jenkins to spawn worker nodes on custom docker images to perform various testing
                            functions. I'm excited to learn more about containerization as I'm hoping to integrate this
                            into the teams development cycle within the workplace. </p>

                        <h3>Agile vs Waterfall</h3>
                        <p> Throughout my school life (GCSE’s / Sixth Form) I learnt a great deal around traditional
                            project management (waterfall) the projects were typically structured with a great deal of
                            emphasis around documentation and a large amount of up-front planning with little leniency
                            to change further down the line. I became confident conducting projects within a waterfall
                            like manner and became used to large amounts of pre-planning such as drafting requirement
                            specs and producing large amounts of testing documentation.
                            <br><br>
                            However, throughout the second year of university I was introduced to the agile methodology,
                            this specifically being scrum. Our second-year project attempted to replicate a scrum team
                            by using methods such as the concept of sprints, burndown charts and story points.
                            <br><br>
                            In my current development role, we stick to agile principals, operate the usual ceremonies
                            and have an agile mindset towards our work. I am comfortable running / leading ceremonies
                            and will often be an influencer within these sessions. I enjoy the concept of 2 week sprints
                            as it allows us to pivot quickly, introduce new technologies with minimal lead time and the
                            ability to fail fast without a massive sunk cost.
                            <br><br>
                            I have attempted to introduce new concepts to the team such as regular cascade sessions /
                            show and tell sessions. We use Agile Central (Rally) to manage our backlog and prioritise
                            items and I am comfortable using this in day to day work. I also use trello for managing my
                            personal development backlog, and am looking forward to dive into it more.

                        <h3>Java / Spring </h3>
                        <p>Java is my language of preference and I have several years of experience especially the last
                            2 at university where I used Java in many projects and became comfortable with many of its
                            advanced features such as multithreading and concurrency, networking using Java sockets and
                            GUI using JavaFX.

                            I have also become adept at the Spring framework and have used it for Java based web
                            applications particularly during my Year 2 group programming project. Here we created an app
                            to allow creators to publish their online learning courses for customers to review buy and
                            consume (Think Udemy). Where Spring security and Hibernate were salient features which
                            helped speed up the development process while proving a solid development model for user
                            collaboration.
                            <br><br> In my day to day development work we are heavily using the Spring ecosystem for
                            REST API development, API Security (Spring Security / OAUTH2), Configuration Management
                            (Spring Cloud Config Server), Spring Data (ORM) and Spring Batch.

                            MySQL to manipulate databases and perform complicated queries to extract data sets. I have
                            recently been using a ORM variant with Spring data / Hibernate which has allowed me to use
                            Java objects (POJO) to manipulate SQL relational databases with no direct SQL commands being
                            needed.</p>

                        <h3>CI / CD</h3>
                        <p>Within my first year in industry I have learnt the in’s and outs of CI and CD by learning
                            Jenkins as extensively as possible and curating a dev lifecycle that provides fully
                            automated front end/ back end test suites, static code analysis (Sonarqube) with custom set
                            quality gates, slack notifications, approval gates and automated environment based
                            deployment via PCF to pre-prod and prod environments. <br><br>
                            In the future I am looking to increase my knowledge of PCF and fully utilise the cloud
                            services it offers – Currently I have implemented spring cloud config server to abstract
                            configuration from the application codebase whilst also having a secure method for secrets
                            management. As a team we are looking to move to a micro-services-based architecture which
                            will bring its own set of opportunities and challenges, as well as migrating to Angular as a
                            front-end framework.

                        <h3>Test Automation</h3>
                        <p>I have been attempting to learn and put into practice most of the stages of the testing
                            pyramid. From end to end tests with selenium webdriver replicating user input on front end
                            pages, to backend unit tests using a combination of JUnit and Mockito along with various
                            other libraries to perform mocks / spies and also actions such as integration tests to test
                            REST API’s and how they integrate with the rest of the system. Whilst dabbling in front-end
                            tests using tools such as Jasmine / Karma.
                            <br><br>
                            I am now confident with the different areas of testing and can create a multitude of
                            automated tests to ensure the system in operating as intended. As I attempt to work more on
                            the front-end side of things, I will be creating more complex front-end tests capturing edge
                            cases in a systematic way whilst working on identifying and improving on weaknesses within
                            my general automated testing development.</p>

                            Visual Basic.Net (VB.Net) is a previous core competencies. It was my primary programming
                            language at A Level and I was involved in a substantial project to make a remote server
                            monitoring system using VB and PHP of which I was awarded a high grade and it was a great
                            entry path to university programming.

                            pattern recognition algorithms; intuitive user interfaces; etc. I also keep up with
                            developments regarding this such as via reading futurism.com on a frequent basis. I am also
                            an avid reader of Dev.to and Medium.com and find that many articles provide examples which
                            add value to my personal/professional development.

                            marketing and have previously performed this with social involvement sites such as Facebook
                            and Youtube.

                            SEO - In the past I have had a great deal of experience with search engine optimization
                            (SEO), primarily with YouTube and Google and have studied techniques and methods to rank
                            websites and videos high up in the search engines.

                                                        Computer undergraduates. The brief was to design and develop a
                                                        course sharing website where authors could monetise and share
                                                        their courses with customers and an admin could have an overview
                                                        and moderate the system.

                                                        <br>
                                                        The project was developed using a range of frameworks, the main
                                                        one being Spring MVC which provided the base structure. However,
                                                        many more technologies were used on top of this such as Spring
                                                        security, Spring data, Hibernate, Bootstrap and many more. A
                                                        MySQL Database was used in conjunction with the website and
                                                        Hibernate was used to interact with the system as it allowed for
                                                        NOSQL commands plus native SQL scripting when needed.

                                                        <br>
                                                        Unfortunately, my project members were unwilling to help and
                                                        only contributed towards the later stages of the project after
                                                        nagging by myself and lecturers. Consequently, the project was
                                                        not completed to the standard that I would have wished for.
                                                        However, between the members who did eventually contribute, we
                                                        managed to complete most of the documentation and a large amount
                                                        of manual testing which was documented.
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        Throughout the project I carried out all the programming and
                                                        contributed a substantial amount to documentation. My colleagues
                                                        completed the documentation by keeping the project backlog up to
                                                        date and collaborating to finish various documents such as the
                                                        sprint retrospective. Although, in many ways, I was disappointed
                                                        with the result, the whole project process was a great eye
                                                        opener to me. I learned a lot technically and a lot about team
                                                        dynamics and the difficulty of managing team members who are not
                                                        invested in a project.

                                                        I believe it was probably the most educating work I have
                                                        conducted at university. It was a large project and the
                                                        technical and development problem solving was basically down to
                                                        me. This gave me great latitude and allowed me to literally
                                                        “own” the project.

                                                        <br>

                                                        The University graded my overall grade for the project at 84%
                                                        which was a mark that was brought up from around 50% for the
                                                        group and my individual grade for the largest worksheet which
                                                        involved the bulk of the programming at 97% - Which was a great
                                                        result and a fantastic reward for the hard work that was put
                                                        into the project.

                                                        brief was to design a multi-threaded hangman game, which
                                                        included such features as: difficulty selection; text file

                                                        by serialization of the java objects; and a GUI design using

                                                        The project was a reasonable success and a 2.1 grade was awarded
                                                        for the application. The project introduced me into Java GUI
                                                        programming using a more modern framework as opposed to Swing
                                                        and I have made applications since using this framework as I
                                                        believe it is a solid choice for Java programming. The project

                                                    <p>This program was developed as part of my second year Operating
                                                        Systems and Networking module. It was developed to help
                                                        represent the way operating systems use networks to communicate
                                                        to each other. The software uses Java socket connections to
                                                        connect an unlimited number of clients to a listening server
                                                        that is multi-threaded and uses a thread pool handler to
                                                        delegate a new thread to each new connection that comes in. The
                                                        program also has built in exception handling to deal with
                                                        connection drops and user errors. There are a select number of
                                                        commands that the user can send to the server, which has a hash
                                                        map coded message board, where messages can be sent to and read
                                                        from.

                                                        <br>

                                                        The program worked well with quite a few test cases however
                                                        could have been improved with slightly more validation such as
                                                        Regex and a GUI could be used with the foundations that have
                                                        been set in place to deliver an attractive functioning chat
                                                        messaging client and server.

                                                    <p>The 3D project for my university second year Multimedia and
                                                        Computer Graphics module was to design a 3D train scene using
                                                        the Java3D framework. This framework uses the notion of scene
                                                        graphs for graphics manipulation and was an interesting way of
                                                        designing a scene. The code was manually typed in as Java3D does
                                                        not have any GUI tools to generate the objects, properties,
                                                        geometries and transformations used in the program.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Furthermore, basic lighting was applied to the geometric shapes
                                                        and different textures were applied to the objects such as matte
                                                        colours. Rotation interpolators were also used as part of the
                                                        Java3D framework which allowed for animation of the wheels by
                                                        specifying such dimensions as rotation angle and time taken.
                                                        Some basic mathematics was also used in the program as
                                                        translations had to be defined in terms of vectors and π for the
                                                        rotation of objects.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        This program was an interesting insight into designing graphics
                                                        from scratch as opposed to using a modern GUI tool to automate
                                                        the process, however there was a lack of documentation online
                                                        for various functions of Java3D, which made the programming a
                                                        tad more difficult than it should have been. I would prefer to
                                                        work with a more modern and better documented framework in the
                                                        future.
